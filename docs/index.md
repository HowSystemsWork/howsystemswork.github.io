# About

Hi there! Welcome my blog `How Systems Work?`! I'm Bharat, and I'm a distributed systems engineer with about 7 years
of experience building highly scalable data engineering platforms and distributed systems.

I like writing about a wide range of software and systems engineering topics that I find interesting. I also write to
reinforce my own systems engineering knowledge :)

Check out my posts if you're generally inquisitive and want to deep dive and understand software, databases, data
engineering concepts, distributed systems and so much more, in detail!

And if you want to say hello, my email is `bharatnc [at] gmail [dot] com`. Thank you for stopping by :)
